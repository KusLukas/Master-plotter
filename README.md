Simlpe GUI for visualization of rotational and vibrational temperatures from massiveOES. Saving function was never finished as it was deemd unnesecery and loading is limited, I am planning to adjust in the future.

Presented GUI has limited capabilities and its main purpose is just visualization of fitted json files from massiveOES, I have better more complex scripts which I did not have chance to implement here or were not pracitle
to implement into GUI. If you are interested feel free to cantact me on lkusyn@main.muni.cz
